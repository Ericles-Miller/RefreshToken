# Refresh Token Model API

## description 
This project implements an authentication and authorization system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), with support for Refresh Tokens. The objective is to ensure security and efficiency in the authentication process, allowing the renewal of access tokens without the need to repeatedly request user credentials.
Main Features Authentication with JWT: Generation of access tokens (Access Tokens) that contain user authentication and authorization information, allowing access to protected resources. Refresh Tokens: Implementation of Refresh Tokens that allow obtaining new Access Tokens without the need for user reauthentication. Security: Use of best practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of tokens, including the use of secure signature algorithms. Token Validation and Revocation: Mechanisms to validate the authenticity and validity of tokens, in addition to enabling the revocation of compromised or expired Refresh Tokens. Project Components Authentication Server: Responsible for authenticating users and issuing tokens (Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens) after validating credentials. Protected API: Endpoints that require a valid Access Token for access, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected resources. Refresh Mechanism: Specific endpoints for exchanging Refresh Tokens for new Access Tokens, keeping the user session active without the need for a new login. Database: Stores information about users and Refresh Tokens, including issuance data and expiration status. Login Authentication Flow: The user sends their credentials (username and password) to the authentication server. The server validates the credentials and, if they are correct, issues an Access Token and a Refresh Token. Access to Resources: The user uses the Access Token to access the API's protected resources. The API validates the Access Token on each request. Token Renewal: When the Access Token expires, the user sends the Refresh Token to the authentication server. The server validates the Refresh Token and, if valid, issues a new Access Token. Logout and Revocation: The user can log out, invalidating the Refresh Token, so that it cannot be used again to obtain new Access Tokens. Benefits Security: Using JWT with Refresh Tokens increases security, avoiding the need for long-term storage of credentials. Efficiency: Allows the renewal of access tokens without the need for frequent re-authentication, improving the user experience. Scalability: The system is easily scalable and can handle a large number of users and authentication requests.
